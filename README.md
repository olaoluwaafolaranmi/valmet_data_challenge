# valmet_data_challenge

This challenge aims to identify which measurements affect the paper's roughness (Sensor Name: Roughness) and 
create a prediction model for roughness. Roughness is a quality measurement made in a laboratory every time a roll 
of paper is finished. However, the factory would like to know what the value could be based on the sensor data.  

Based on the model and your findings, give recommendations what operator could do to improve the roughness and 
how the model itself could be improved?
